# **Prog5_MembershipDiscountCalc (Supermarket Checkout Program)**

## **Description**
This program simulates a supermarket checkout system. It calculates the user's final purchase total based on the input amount and applies discounts if applicable:
- If the purchase total exceeds $1000:
  - Members get a 10% discount.
  - Non-members get a 5% discount.
- If the purchase total is $1000 or less, no discount is applied.
- If the purchase total is zero or negative, the program notifies the user that the amount is invalid.

## **Features**
- Handles user input validation for purchase amounts and membership status.
- Applies discounts dynamically based on user input.
- Ensures accurate calculation and formatting of monetary values.
- Includes functionality to clear the console for smoother user experience.
