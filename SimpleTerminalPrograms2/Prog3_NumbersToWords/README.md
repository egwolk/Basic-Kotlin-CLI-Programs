# **Number to Words Converter**

## **Description**
This program converts positive whole numbers (0-9,999) into their word representations. Users can either input a specific number to convert or view all numbers from 0 to 9,999 along with their word equivalents. It also includes interactive options for navigating and exiting the program.

## **Features**
- Converts numbers from 0 to 9,999 into words.
- Handles validation for input to ensure only positive whole numbers in the specified range are accepted.
- Allows users to view individual number conversions or all numbers in the range.
- Includes console-clearing functionality for improved readability and user experience.

## **How to Run**

   - Ensure you have a Java Runtime Environment installed.
2. **Steps**:
   - Open the folder containing the `.bat` (Windows) or `.sh` (Linux/macOS) file.
   - Run the appropriate file for your operating system:
     - **Windows**: Double-click the `.bat` file.
     - **Linux/macOS**: Execute the `.sh` file in your terminal using the command:
